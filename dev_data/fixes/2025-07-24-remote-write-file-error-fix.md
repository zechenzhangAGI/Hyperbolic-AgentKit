# Remote Write File Error Fix

**Date**: 2025-07-24
**Issue**: Agent calling remote_write_file without required 'content' parameter
**Status**: Fixed

## Problem

The agent was repeatedly failing with this error:
```
Error: 1 validation error for RemoteWriteFileInput
content
  Field required [type=missing, input_value={'file_path': 'optimizer_comparison.py'}, input_type=dict]
```

The agent was trying to call `remote_write_file` with only the `file_path` parameter, missing the required `content` parameter.

## Root Cause

The tool description wasn't explicit enough about BOTH parameters being required. The LLM might have been confused about whether it needs to provide the content upfront or if the tool would prompt for it.

## Solution

Updated the tool prompt and field descriptions to be much clearer:

1. **Clearer Prompt Structure**:
   - Added "REQUIRED parameters" section
   - Added "OPTIONAL parameters" section
   - Added example usage
   - Emphasized that content is REQUIRED

2. **Better Field Descriptions**:
   - Added examples in the descriptions
   - Explicitly stated "REQUIRED" for content
   - Clarified what content means

## Updated Prompt

```
REQUIRED parameters:
- file_path: The path where to write the file (e.g., "/home/user/script.py")
- content: The actual text/code content to write to the file (REQUIRED - cannot be empty)

Example usage:
  file_path: "experiment.py"
  content: "import torch\nprint('Hello world')"
  append: false
```

## Why This Happens

LLMs sometimes struggle with tool calling when:
1. Multiple parameters are required
2. The relationship between parameters isn't clear
3. The tool name might suggest it works differently

In this case, the agent might have thought it could specify just the file path and then be prompted for content, similar to how some interactive tools work.

## Prevention

For future tools:
1. Always use "REQUIRED" and "OPTIONAL" sections in prompts
2. Provide concrete examples in the prompt
3. Make parameter descriptions very explicit
4. Consider parameter naming (e.g., "file_content" might be clearer than "content")
